# Validity Layer

The Validity module contains the "Golden Theorems" that bridge computational
results (Bool) to semantic proofs (Prop).

## Philosophy

This layer embodies the core LeanCert principle: **Certification is the Product**.
The Engine computes numbers; Validity turns them into theorems.

## Main Components

* `Validity.Bounds` - Golden Theorems for interval bounds:
  - `checkUpperBound` (Bool) → `verify_upper_bound` (Prop)
  - `checkLowerBound` (Bool) → `verify_lower_bound` (Prop)

* `Validity.Types` - Certificate structures:
  - `VerifiedGlobalMin` - Proven global minimum
  - `VerifiedGlobalMax` - Proven global maximum
  - `VerifiedRoot` - Proven root existence
