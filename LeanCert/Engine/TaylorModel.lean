# Taylor Models

This file re-exports all Taylor model functionality. The implementation is split into:

* `TaylorModel.Core` - Core data structure, polynomial helpers, basic operations
* `TaylorModel.Functions` - Function-specific Taylor series (sin, cos, exp, etc.)
* `TaylorModel.Expr` - Composition operations and expression integration
