# Discovery Types (Re-export)

This module re-exports `LeanCert.Validity.Types` for backward compatibility.
The certificate types have been moved to the Validity layer to reflect
the LeanCert philosophy of separating Engine (computation) from
Validity (certification).

## Migration

Old import: `import LeanCert.Discovery.Types`
New import: `import LeanCert.Validity.Types`

Both continue to work.
-/

namespace LeanCert.Discovery

-- Re-export all certificate types from Validity
export LeanCert.Validity (
  DiscoveryConfig
  VerifiedGlobalMin
  VerifiedGlobalMax
  VerifiedRoot
  UniqueVerifiedRoot
  VerifiedIntegral
  VerifiedUpperBound
  VerifiedLowerBound
  VerifiedBoxBound
)

end LeanCert.Discovery
